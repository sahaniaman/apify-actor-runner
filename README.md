## üìù Testing Information

### Test Actor
For testing purposes, we used the "Website Content Crawler" actor from the Apify store, which allows crawling and extracting data from websites with configurable depth and content filters.

### Design Choices & Assumptions
- **React Framework**: Chosen for its component-based architecture and efficient rendering
- **Context API**: Used for global state management instead of Redux for simplicity
- **Modular Design**: Components are highly reusable and follow single responsibility principle
- **API Caching**: Implemented to minimize requests to Apify API
- **Assumption**: Users have basic familiarity with JSON structure for manual input mode

## üì∏ Application Workflow

The application follows this general workflow:
1. Login with Apify API key
2. Browse and select an actor
3. Configure actor input parameters
4. Run the actor and monitor execution
5. View and analyze results
